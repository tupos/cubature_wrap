Intro
-----

This is a `C++` wrapper for [cubature][cubature] `C` library. 

The main goal that I wanted to achieve is to obtain the syntax as
close as possible to `mathematica`, i.e.,

```c++
cub::make_cubature_int(F, limit, x_min, x_max,
eps_abs, eps_rel, norm)
```

where `F` is any callable object, with the following signature

```c++
std::array<double, F_SIZE> (*)(const std::array<double, X_SIZE> &)
```

Luckily, the modern `C++` standard allows one to have such a clean
syntax. Therefore, the wrapper implements a single function, which is
located in the namespace `cub` and has the signature

```c++
std::array<std::array<double,2>, F_SIZE>
make_cubature_int(
				F func,
				std::size_t limit,
				const std::array<double,X_SIZE>& x_min,
				const std::array<double,X_SIZE>& x_max,
				double eps_abs,
				double eps_rel,
				error_norm norm = ERROR_INDIVIDUAL
				)
```

However, the length of the vector function `F_SIZE` and the dimension
of the integration `X_SIZE` are determined by the compiler
automatically through the templates.

This function returns a two dimensional array of length `F_SIZE`,
where the first array element is the result and the second element is
the error respectively.

Consequently, the actual usage is the following

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <cmath>

#include <cubature_wrap.hpp>

std::array<double,1> f(const std::array<double,3> &x){
	double e = 0.;
	for(const auto &el: x){
		e += el*el;
	}
	return {exp(-e)};
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

	double lim = 5. * 1./sqrt(2.);
	std::array<double,3> x_min = {-lim,-lim,-lim};
	std::array<double,3> x_max = {lim,lim,lim};
	double eps_abs = 0.0001;
	double eps_rel = 0.0001;

	std::cout << "gauss 3d = "
	   << cub::make_cubature_int(
			   f,100000,x_min,x_max,eps_abs,eps_rel)[0][0] << "\n";
	std::cout << "exact result = " << sqrt(M_PI) * M_PI << "\n";
	
	return 0;
}
```

Installation
------------
If installed in the non standard location the following steps are
necessary

```
git clone https://www.github.com/tupos/cubature_wrap
cd cub_wrap
git submodule init
git submodule update
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=INSTALLATION_PATH ..
make
make install
```

where `INSTALLATION_PATH` is the installation path. If removed the
default is used.

Then in order to check that everyting is working as expected one can
save the above test file lets say into `main.cpp` and compile and link

on Mac OS for example

```
g++ -o cubature_test main.cpp -IINSTALLATION_PATH/include -LINSTALLATION_PATH/lib -std=c++14 -lcubature -rpath INSTALLATION_PATH/lib

./cubature_test
```

On linux one should ommit `-rpath` and everything after it and run the
program 
```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=INSTALLATION_PATH/lib ./cubature_test
```
